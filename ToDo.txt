-This is a list of changes/modifications to make to the WBM VisTrails Package

General Model notes
--------------------
-List of python/R dependencies outside of base packages
-Short List of descriptions of ind codes and functions
-Create mechansim/stopping point so if the program cuts out (such as during GDP step), entire program does not have to rerun

I.Model Input
--------------
-Fill out background and description of arguments in the module information portion
-Change name of Calibration Start Date/End Date arguments to Simulation Start Date/End Date
-Create pyGDP module for soil moisture storage capacity

II.NWIS Streamflow
------------------

III. GDP
--------
-Fix GDP for current conditions, cutting off the first month of temperature for monthly climate data
-Modify GDP for future conditions to include CMIP5 data
-Ensure that when downloading downscaled data and GDP process is cut off, module does not retrieve climate
 data that has successfully been downloaded and formatted
 
IV. WBM (CC)
------------
-Enable model simulation and performance statistics for the evalaution period
-Modify monthly hydrograph for POR so that line for simulated data is red, not black
-Ensure if there is NA for measured streamflow for a certain POR, NA for those timesteps are being carried over to the climate data

V. WBM (FC)
-----------
-Need to hookup and make active for the program
-Finish graphics package
